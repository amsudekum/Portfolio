## Making a Portfolio to Share my Work
 
 My goal was to make a portfolio where I can feature applications I've created to future employers. I spent a good amount of time researching color stories and fonts, as I wanted to present a page that was cohesive and visually pleasing. As of right now, I don't have any applications so I created place holder images that went along with the theme I was hoping to convey.
